In this problem we have a .jpg file with some strange symbols. It seems like we need to decode this symbols to make and produce a meaningful message:

If we search the problem's description coordinates in google, we come up with a link featuring stones with similiar patterns called Ogham stones. Searching Ogham stones we find that the symbols given in the first image are some kind of inscription. All we have to do is to decode the symbols and produce the message. 

I used [this](http://nuacht1.com/ogham/) site to do it.

After decoding we get the flag:
```
NOTUNICODECOMPATIBLE
```
